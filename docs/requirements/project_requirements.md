# Project Domain Requirements Specification

## 1. Overview
The Project domain represents a collection of related tasks that work toward achieving a specific goal or deliverable within the project management system.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Project Creation (FR-P-001)
**Description**: Users must be able to create new projects
**Priority**: High
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- A project MUST have a unique identifier (UUID)
- A project MUST have a non-empty name (1-100 characters)
- A project MAY have a description (0-500 characters)
- A project MUST have an owner (User ID)
- A project MUST have creation and last updated timestamps
- A project MUST start with "Active" status by default

### 2.2 Project Information Management (FR-P-002)
**Description**: Users must be able to update project information
**Priority**: High
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Owner MUST be able to update project name
- Owner MUST be able to update project description
- System MUST update the "updated_at" timestamp on any modification
- Changes MUST be validated before saving

### 2.3 Project Status Management (FR-P-003)
**Description**: Users must be able to manage project lifecycle
**Priority**: High
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Project status MUST be one of: Active, Archived, Completed
- Only project owner or admin CAN change project status
- Status changes MUST update the "updated_at" timestamp
- Archived projects SHOULD be read-only for tasks
- Completed projects SHOULD be read-only

### 2.4 Project Validation (FR-P-004)
**Description**: System must validate all project data
**Priority**: High
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Project name MUST NOT be empty or only whitespace
- Project name MUST NOT exceed 100 characters
- Project description MUST NOT exceed 500 characters if provided
- Owner ID MUST be a valid UUID
- Validation MUST occur before create/update operations

### 2.5 Project Query and Display (FR-P-005)
**Description**: Users must be able to view project information
**Priority**: Medium
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Projects MUST display name, status, and description
- Projects MUST show creation and last updated dates
- Projects MUST show owner information
- System MUST support filtering by status
- System MUST support searching by name/description

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Performance (NFR-P-001)
- Project creation MUST complete within 100ms
- Project queries MUST return results within 200ms
- System MUST support 1000+ concurrent project operations

### 3.2 Data Integrity (NFR-P-002)
- All project data MUST be validated before persistence
- Project relationships MUST maintain referential integrity
- Data corruption MUST be prevented through validation

### 3.3 Security (NFR-P-003)
- Only authenticated users CAN create projects
- Only project owners or admins CAN modify projects
- All project operations MUST be auditable

### 3.4 Usability (NFR-P-004)
- Project creation MUST be intuitive and require minimal fields
- Error messages MUST be clear and actionable
- Project status MUST be visually distinguishable

## 4. Business Rules

### 4.1 Project Lifecycle (BR-P-001)
- Projects start as "Active" by default
- Active projects can be moved to Archived or Completed
- Archived projects can be reactivated or marked as Completed
- Completed projects cannot change status (final state)

### 4.2 Project Ownership (BR-P-002)
- Each project MUST have exactly one owner
- Project ownership CAN be transferred to another user
- Owner changes MUST be logged for audit purposes

### 4.3 Project Dependencies (BR-P-003)
- Projects with active tasks CANNOT be deleted
- Archived projects SHOULD restrict new task creation
- Completed projects SHOULD be read-only

## 5. Data Model

```rust
pub struct Project {
    pub id: Uuid,                    // Unique identifier
    pub name: String,                // 1-100 characters
    pub description: Option<String>, // 0-500 characters
    pub status: ProjectStatus,       // Active|Archived|Completed
    pub owner_id: Uuid,             // Reference to User
    pub created_at: DateTime<Utc>,  // Creation timestamp
    pub updated_at: DateTime<Utc>,  // Last modification timestamp
}

pub enum ProjectStatus {
    Active,
    Archived, 
    Completed,
}
```

## 6. API Requirements

### 6.1 Create Project
- **Endpoint**: POST /projects
- **Input**: name, description?, owner_id
- **Output**: Created project with generated ID and timestamps
- **Status Codes**: 201 Created, 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized

### 6.2 Update Project
- **Endpoint**: PUT /projects/{id}
- **Input**: name?, description?, status?
- **Output**: Updated project
- **Status Codes**: 200 OK, 400 Bad Request, 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found

### 6.3 Get Project
- **Endpoint**: GET /projects/{id}
- **Output**: Project details
- **Status Codes**: 200 OK, 404 Not Found

### 6.4 List Projects
- **Endpoint**: GET /projects
- **Query Parameters**: status?, owner_id?, search?
- **Output**: List of projects with pagination
- **Status Codes**: 200 OK

## 7. Test Scenarios

### 7.1 Valid Project Creation
- Create project with valid name and owner
- Verify all fields are set correctly
- Verify timestamps are current

### 7.2 Invalid Project Creation
- Attempt creation with empty name (should fail)
- Attempt creation with oversized name (should fail)
- Attempt creation with invalid owner (should fail)

### 7.3 Project Status Transitions
- Test all valid status transitions
- Verify timestamp updates
- Test business rule enforcement

### 7.4 Project Validation
- Test all validation rules
- Verify error messages are appropriate
- Test edge cases (whitespace, special characters)

## 8. Constraints and Assumptions

### 8.1 Technical Constraints
- Project IDs must be UUIDs for uniqueness across distributed systems
- Timestamps must be in UTC to avoid timezone issues
- Text fields must support Unicode for internationalization

### 8.2 Business Assumptions
- Projects represent discrete work units with clear goals
- Project ownership is singular but transferable
- Project archival is for historical reference, not deletion
