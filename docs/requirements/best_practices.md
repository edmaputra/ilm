# Requirements Specification Best Practices Guide

## 1. Structure and Organization

### 1.1 Standard Template
Every requirement specification should include:
- **Overview**: Purpose and scope
- **Functional Requirements**: What the system must do
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: How the system must perform
- **Business Rules**: Domain-specific constraints and logic
- **Data Model**: Structure and relationships
- **API Requirements**: Interface specifications
- **Test Scenarios**: Validation criteria
- **Constraints and Assumptions**: Limitations and expectations

### 1.2 Requirement Identification
Use consistent naming conventions:
- **FR-[Domain]-[Number]**: Functional Requirements (e.g., FR-P-001)
- **NFR-[Domain]-[Number]**: Non-Functional Requirements (e.g., NFR-P-001)
- **BR-[Domain]-[Number]**: Business Rules (e.g., BR-P-001)

### 1.3 Priority Classification
- **High**: Core functionality, system cannot operate without it
- **Medium**: Important features that enhance user experience
- **Low**: Nice-to-have features that can be deferred

## 2. Writing Quality Requirements

### 2.1 SMART Criteria
Requirements should be:
- **Specific**: Clear and unambiguous
- **Measurable**: Quantifiable success criteria
- **Achievable**: Technically and practically feasible
- **Relevant**: Aligned with business objectives
- **Time-bound**: Clear implementation timeline

### 2.2 Language Guidelines
- Use **MUST** for mandatory requirements
- Use **SHOULD** for recommended practices
- Use **MAY** or **CAN** for optional features
- Use **MUST NOT** for prohibited actions
- Avoid ambiguous terms like "fast", "user-friendly", "robust"

### 2.3 Acceptance Criteria
Each functional requirement should include:
- Clear input conditions
- Expected system behavior
- Observable output or state change
- Error conditions and handling
- Performance expectations

## 3. Domain Modeling Best Practices

### 3.1 Entity Definition
For each domain entity:
- Define core attributes with types and constraints
- Specify required vs optional fields
- Document relationships to other entities
- Include audit fields (created_at, updated_at)
- Define unique identifiers (preferably UUIDs)

### 3.2 State Management
- Define all possible states/statuses
- Document valid state transitions
- Specify business rules governing state changes
- Include terminal states (final states)
- Define default/initial states

### 3.3 Validation Rules
- Field-level validations (length, format, type)
- Cross-field validations (dependencies)
- Business rule validations
- Referential integrity constraints
- Input sanitization requirements

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Performance Requirements
Specify concrete metrics:
- Response time limits (e.g., "< 200ms")
- Throughput requirements (e.g., "1000 ops/sec")
- Concurrent user capacity
- Data volume limits
- Resource utilization bounds

### 4.2 Security Requirements
- Authentication requirements
- Authorization and access control
- Data protection and encryption
- Audit trail requirements
- Compliance requirements (GDPR, etc.)

### 4.3 Reliability Requirements
- Availability targets (e.g., "99.9% uptime")
- Error handling and recovery
- Data backup and recovery
- Disaster recovery procedures
- Graceful degradation behavior

## 5. API Design Requirements

### 5.1 RESTful Principles
- Resource-based URLs
- HTTP method semantics
- Consistent response formats
- Proper status codes
- Stateless operations

### 5.2 Input/Output Specifications
- Request/response schemas
- Content type requirements
- Parameter validation rules
- Error response formats
- Pagination specifications

### 5.3 API Versioning
- Version strategy (URL, header, etc.)
- Backward compatibility requirements
- Deprecation procedures
- Migration guidelines

## 6. Testing Requirements

### 6.1 Test Case Categories
- **Happy Path**: Normal operation scenarios
- **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions
- **Error Cases**: Invalid inputs and error conditions
- **Integration Cases**: Cross-domain interactions
- **Performance Cases**: Load and stress testing

### 6.2 Test Data Requirements
- Sample data specifications
- Test data generation rules
- Data privacy in testing
- Test environment setup
- Automated test requirements

## 7. Documentation Standards

### 7.1 Traceability
- Link requirements to business objectives
- Map requirements to test cases
- Connect requirements to implementation
- Maintain requirement history and changes

### 7.2 Review Process
- Stakeholder review requirements
- Technical feasibility assessment
- Business value validation
- Conflict resolution procedures
- Approval and sign-off process

## 8. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 8.1 Specification Issues
- Ambiguous or vague requirements
- Missing error conditions
- Incomplete acceptance criteria
- Conflicting requirements
- Over-specification (implementation details)

### 8.2 Domain Modeling Issues
- Anemic domain models (missing behavior)
- God objects (overly complex entities)
- Missing relationships
- Inconsistent naming conventions
- Poor abstraction levels

### 8.3 Process Issues
- Requirements gathering without stakeholder input
- No validation against business objectives
- Insufficient technical review
- Poor change management
- Inadequate documentation maintenance

## 9. Tools and Templates

### 9.1 Documentation Tools
- Markdown for version-controlled specs
- UML for visual modeling
- API documentation generators (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Requirements management tools (Jira, Azure DevOps)

### 9.2 Validation Tools
- Schema validators for data models
- API testing tools (Postman, Insomnia)
- Static analysis for code compliance
- Automated acceptance test frameworks

## 10. Continuous Improvement

### 10.1 Feedback Loops
- Regular requirement reviews
- Implementation feedback integration
- User acceptance testing results
- Production monitoring insights

### 10.2 Metrics and KPIs
- Requirement completeness metrics
- Defect traceability to requirements
- Implementation effort vs estimates
- User satisfaction with delivered features
